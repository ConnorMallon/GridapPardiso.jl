# MTYPE: Pardiso matrix type
# This scalar value defines the matrix type. PARDISO supports the following matrices

# Real matrices

MatrixTypes = Base.ImmutableDict(MatrixTypes, "Real_NonSymmetric"                 => 11)
# Complex matrices

# PHASE: Controls the execution of the solver
# 
# Usually it is a two- or three-digit integer. 
# The first digit indicates the starting phase of execution and the second digit indicates the ending phase. 
# Intel MKL PARDISO has the following phases of execution:
# 1. Phase 1: Fill-reduction analysis and symbolic factorization
# 2. Phase 2: Numerical factorization
# 3. Phase 3: Forward and Backward solve including iterative refinement.
#             This phase can be divided into two or three separate substitutions: forward, backward, and diagonal.
# 4. Termination and Memory Release Phase (PHASE â‰¤ 0)
